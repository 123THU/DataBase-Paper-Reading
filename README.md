# DataBase-Paper-Reading

This repo is created to record my own learning path in database. Its birthday is 2024.7.24, 2:21 a.m.


# Why this repo is created?
It could be credited to two reasons: 

1. First, there is not a single teacher in my university whose research area is database.
   
2. Second, one of my teachers who majors in CV is recruiting undergraduate student to join his lab. So I decided to mimic his pattern of cultivating the scientific research capacity of students to cultivate myself.


# What will be submitted in this repo?

* Paper List
* Paper Reading Method
* My Own Reading Notes and Videos

I will try to make everything as clear as possible. It will be so excited if it could be helpful for you. Anyway, I'm just a freshman, if there is any problem or suggestion, please feel free to let me know.
